Responsive Web Design Project Tasked on Codecademy

This project I layed out the header to be quite complex so after fiddling with the sizing's for Mobile and Tablet I realised I needed to restructure the header to be more simple. I was inspired by the example method but also some other examples on Youtube and MDN. 

Any feedback would be much appreciated.
